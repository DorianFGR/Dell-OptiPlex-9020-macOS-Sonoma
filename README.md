## July 2022 PSA: While Venture is in beta I will not be doing any testing this time. The last time a lot of things kept changing and it took a few weeks before all the needed kexts and OpenCore were workingproperly with Monterey. I will begin my Ventura testing when the GM is announced or released. This project is not dead yet.

## PSA: From the 24th of June 2021 the default SMBIOS has been changed. This means that when you update you will either have generate new serials and before doing so logout from the iMessage and Facetime apps as well as iCloud itself. Or you can of course change the SMBIOS back to iMac15,1 or iMac14,3, if you do so you'll also need edit the plist inside USBPorts.kext to match the new model. This change is done so we can install Monterey.
